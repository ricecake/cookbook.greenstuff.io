[{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 8 ounces (227 grams) butter unsalted, softened 2/3 cup (64 grams) granulated sugar 2 large eggs, room temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 1/4 cups (330 grams) all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup (64 grams) raspberry jam Directions Combine butter, sugar and eggs.\nAdd the butter (227g) and sugar (64g) to a stand mixer or mixing bowl. Beat until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and continue to mix. Mix in the vanilla (1tsp). Allow to mix until incorporated, scraping sides as needed. While butter/sugar incorperates, mix the the flour (330g) and salt (1/4tsp) together in a seperate bowl.\nOnce incorporated, add 1/3 of the flower to the butter and mix.\nContinue like this until all flour incorporated.\nit will resemble large crumbles. If the mix is too wet, add a little more flour. Dough should not be sticky. Do not over mix. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface (no flour).\nUse your hands to start pressing the crumbs together, not too much or you can overwork the dough and this will result in hard cookies.\nIt will be crumbly and feel like it won’t come together but it will, just press until it stays together. If you cannot get the dough to stay together, dip your hand in water and sprinkle water over the dough to moisten, not too much or the cookies will spread too much when baking. Prepare two sheets of plastic wrap.\nSeperate half (~340g) of the dough onto each sheet.\nFlatten the dough slightly, and use plastic wrap to guide dough into rough squares.\nPlace into refridgerator.\nPreheat oven to 350°F/176°C.\nrefrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nYou can also refrigerate overnight. Place a large piece of baking paper/parchment paper onto your work surface.\nplace one piece of dough onto parchement paper.\nIf dough is sticky, dust parchement paper and dough with flour to prevent sticking. Place another piece of parchement paper on top and roll out the dough to 1/4\u0026quot; (6 mm) thick.\nUse a 2-1/2\u0026quot;/6 cm fluted cookie cutter, dip in flour, then cut out the cookies.\nUse a thin spatula to remove and place on a parchment covered baking sheet evenly apart. Use a small heart-shaped cutter and cut a heart in the center of half of the cookies.\nBake 15-20 minutes until they start to turn golden brown on the edges but the tops are still pale\nRemove from the oven and allow to cool on the pan for 2 minutes.\nTransfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.\nRepeat with the other piece of dough.\nOnce cookies are cooled, take a cookie without a heart and spread 1/4tsp of jam with more in the center than the edges.\nThis way it will rise up through the heart. Top with a heart cut-out cookie.\n","imageLink":"/images/defaultImage.jpg","permalink":"https://cookbook.greenstuff.io/cider-jammy-dodgers/","tags":["cookie","cider","dessert","snack","sweet"],"title":"Cider Jammy Dodgers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Kidney beans black beans potatoes onion powder garlic powder salt pepper rice cumin cinnamon vegetable out Directions Acquire kidney beans, black beans, potatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, cooking oil, rice, and optionally cumin and cinnamon. Add one half part kidney beans, one half part black beans, and four parts water into a large pot. Bring the water to a strong boil, and then stir, and reduce to a simmer. Allow to simmer while covered. Before you add the water, make sure to sort through the beans for stones, goya brand beans have a problem with that. Do something else for fifteen to twenty minutes, and then return to the pot and stir the beans. If the water has lowered in volume significantly, replace it, increase heat to boil, and then reduce back to simmer. Repeat this step for about one hour. At this point, take approximately two to three parts potato, and cut them into small chunks. Add these chunks to the pot, and continue to boil for about one and a half more hours, or until the beans are tender. A good sign that this has happened is that a small selection of the beans will have had their skins split. This is the point where the recipe becomes slightly more labor intensive for about 20-30 minutes. Add about four to five parts water to the pot, depending on if you want the dish to come out more watery, or more firm. You need at least three parts to ensure that the rice can cook properly though. Increase the heat to full, and while the new water is coming up to temperature, add a hearty portion of cooking oil, approximately enough that the surface of the water is 85% coated. Not too much though, or else it\u0026rsquo;s weird. Add one part rice to the mix, and stir firmly for about a minute. You want everything to get slightly oily, and cause the oil to break up into small little droplets. It will look pretty. At this point, you have reached the seasoning stage. Be vaguely swift in this, and take time to stir on occasion, as rice the adheres to the bottom of the pot is dippy. Add a significant amount of garlic powder. You can\u0026rsquo;t really have too much I\u0026rsquo;ve decided. Add a significant amount of salt as well, as it helps the carbohydrates in the dish break down in a palatable fashion. Add a slightly smaller amount of onion powder. You want the flavor to be more subtle than the garlic, in my opinion. Do the same for the black pepper. The rice wont be done cooking yet, so you can\u0026rsquo;t taste it to make sure the flavor is right, but smelling it and tasting the broth can give a good indication of where it\u0026rsquo;s going. Be really, really, really conservative if you decide to venture into the land of cinnamon and cumin, as they will hit a carbohydrate based dish like a fire hose. 1/5th the amount of either compared to garlic powder will mask it almost entirely. Stir continuously until such time as the rice is cooked and the consistency has settled to the desired level. It should smell yummy. remove from heat. Eat. Repeat as needed.
