[{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 2 ½ cups (326g / 11.5oz) Cup 4 Cup gluten-free flour OR 2 ½ cups (319g / 11.25oz) all-purpose flour, plus more for workspace ½ teaspoon fine sea salt 1 tablespoon sugar (optional; this can be omitted for savory crusts) 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted, good quality butter (preferably a cultured or European style butter), cut into ½-inch dice 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar ⅓ - ½ cup cold water\nIngredient Subheading First Ingredient Second Ingredient 1 Directions Instructions Put the flour, sea salt and sugar, if using, in a food processor and pulse to combine. Sprinkle the cold butter over the flour in the food processor. Pulse until the mixture looks crumbly with larger, pea-sized chunks of butter (those chunks of butter equal a flaky crust!). Drizzle the apple cider vinegar over top. Turn the machine on and immediately start drizzling cold water through the feed tube. Stop the machine once the mixture starts to come together and looks shaggy. Give the dough a pinch—if it sticks together, it’s ready to go. If not, turn the machine on again and drizzle in a bit more water. You might not need all of the water—you’re looking for a shaggy dough, not a cohesive ball. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and shape it into a ball. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form each into a flat disk. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes or for up to 2 days. Do Ahead: The wrapped disks can be placed in zip-top freezer bags and frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before using. If the dough has been in the fridge for several hours, let it sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 10-20 minutes. Roll it out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. If the dough immediately starts to crack once you start rolling, it’s too cold—give it a few more minutes to warm up. If the edges crack as you roll (which they probably will, so no fear!) simply patch them as needed. Single Crust Pie To blind bake a single pie crust: Preheat the oven to 400˚F. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate, making sure to get in the corners. Using kitchen scissors, trim the dough to a ½-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under to form a ring around the pie plate. Crimp the ring, if you’d like. At this point, if the dough feels like it’s getting soft, pop the pie plate in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to firm up. Prick the bottom all over with a fork. Line the crust with a large piece of parchment paper then pour in dried beans or pie weights to completely cover the bottom. Bake 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and beans. Bake 5 minutes longer, or until light golden on the bottom. Do Ahead: The crust can be blind baked up to 1 day in advance. Double Crust Pie To make a double-crust pie: Preheat the oven to 400˚F. Roll out one disk of dough, and transfer it to a 9-inch pie plate, making sure to get in the corners. Add your fruit filling, and dot with butter. Roll out the second piece of dough and lay it over top. Using kitchen scissors, trim the dough to a ½-inch overhang. Roll the overhang under (pinching the top and bottom dough together) to form a ring around the pie plate. Crimp the ring, if you’d like. At this point, if the dough feels like it’s getting soft, pop the pie in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to firm up. Brush the top dough with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Using a small knife, cut a few vents on top. Bake 35 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F and bake 15-30 minutes longer, or until the fruit is tender and bubbling. If needed, lightly tent the top crust or edges if they start to look too brown near the end of cooking. Notes Tips: I use Cup 4 Cup Gluten Free Flour for this pie crust, which rolls out easily and tastes like a traditional pie crust. You can also use Bob\u0026rsquo;s Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten-Free Baking Flour, but the dough will be much crumblier and can be hard to transfer (it works best as a galette). If you\u0026rsquo;re not gluten-free, you can use any regular all-purpose flour. Use a good quality European-style butter, such as Kerrygold, Plugra or Organic Valley. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-process the butter and flour mixture. The small chunks of butter will give you a flakier crust! The finished dough will still look shaggy and a bit floury in the food processor. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-process, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with a tough crust. The dough will come together on the countertop once you form it into a ball. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a food processor you can make this dough by hand. Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then add the cold butter cubes. Using your fingers (or a pastry cutter), rub the butter into the flour mixture, toss and smashing it until it\u0026rsquo;s incorporated but you still see larger pea sized chunks. Drizzle in the apple cider vinegar and cold water, then toss with a fork until the dough comes together. From there you can turn it out onto a floured piece of parchment paper as indicated in the recipe.

Notes A second crust is needed for the top, if desired.

Add one half part kidney beans, one half part black beans, and four parts water into a large pot. Bring the water to a strong boil, and then stir, and reduce to a simmer. Allow to simmer while covered. Before you add the water, make sure to sort through the beans for stones, goya brand beans have a problem with that. Do something else for fifteen to twenty minutes, and then return to the pot and stir the beans. If the water has lowered in volume significantly, replace it, increase heat to boil, and then reduce back to simmer. Repeat this step for about one hour. At this point, take approximately two to three parts potato, and cut them into small chunks. Add these chunks to the pot, and continue to boil for about one and a half more hours, or until the beans are tender. A good sign that this has happened is that a small selection of the beans will have had their skins split. This is the point where the recipe becomes slightly more labor intensive for about 20-30 minutes. Add about four to five parts water to the pot, depending on if you want the dish to come out more watery, or more firm. You need at least three parts to ensure that the rice can cook properly though. Increase the heat to full, and while the new water is coming up to temperature, add a hearty portion of cooking oil, approximately enough that the surface of the water is 85% coated. Not too much though, or else it\u0026rsquo;s weird. Add one part rice to the mix, and stir firmly for about a minute. You want everything to get slightly oily, and cause the oil to break up into small little droplets. It will look pretty. At this point, you have reached the seasoning stage. Be vaguely swift in this, and take time to stir on occasion, as rice the adheres to the bottom of the pot is dippy. Add a significant amount of garlic powder. You can\u0026rsquo;t really have too much I\u0026rsquo;ve decided. Add a significant amount of salt as well, as it helps the carbohydrates in the dish break down in a palatable fashion. Add a slightly smaller amount of onion powder. You want the flavor to be more subtle than the garlic, in my opinion. Do the same for the black pepper. The rice wont be done cooking yet, so you can\u0026rsquo;t taste it to make sure the flavor is right, but smelling it and tasting the broth can give a good indication of where it\u0026rsquo;s going. Be really, really, really conservative if you decide to venture into the land of cinnamon and cumin, as they will hit a carbohydrate based dish like a fire hose. 1/5th the amount of either compared to garlic powder will mask it almost entirely. Stir continuously until such time as the rice is cooked and the consistency has settled to the desired level. It should smell yummy. remove from heat. Eat. Repeat as needed.
