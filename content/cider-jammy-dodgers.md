## Ingredients
- 8 ounces (227 grams) butter unsalted, softened
- 2/3 cup (64 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups (330 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (64 grams) raspberry jam

## Directions
- Combine butter, sugar and eggs.
    - Add the butter (227g) and sugar (64g) to a stand mixer or mixing bowl.
    - Beat until light and fluffy. 
    - Add the eggs and continue to mix.
    - Mix in the vanilla (1tsp).
    - Allow to mix until incorporated, scraping sides as needed.

- While butter/sugar incorperates, mix the the flour (330g) and salt (1/4tsp) together in a seperate bowl.
- Once incorporated, add 1/3 of the flower to the butter and mix.
- Continue like this until all flour incorporated.
    - it will resemble large crumbles.
    - If the mix is too wet, add a little more flour.
    - Dough should not be sticky.
    - Do not over mix.

- Turn the dough out onto a clean surface (no flour).
- Use your hands to start pressing the crumbs together, not too much or you can overwork the dough and this will result in hard cookies. 
    - It will be crumbly and feel like it won’t come together but it will, just press until it stays together.
    - If you cannot get the dough to stay together, dip your hand in water and sprinkle water over the dough to moisten, not too much or the cookies will spread too much when baking.
- Prepare two sheets of plastic wrap.
- Seperate half (~340g) of the dough onto each sheet.
- Flatten the dough slightly, and use plastic wrap to guide dough into rough squares.
- Place into refridgerator.
- Preheat oven to 350°F/176°C.
- refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
    - You can also refrigerate overnight.

- Place a large piece of baking paper/parchment paper onto your work surface.
- place one piece of dough onto parchement paper.
    - If dough is sticky, dust parchement paper and dough with flour to prevent sticking. 
- Place another piece of parchement paper on top and roll out the dough to 1/4" (6 mm) thick.
- Use a 2-1/2"/6 cm fluted cookie cutter, dip in flour, then cut out the cookies.
    - Use a thin spatula to remove and place on a parchment covered baking sheet evenly apart.
- Use a small heart-shaped cutter and cut a heart in the center of half of the cookies.
- Bake 15-20 minutes until they start to turn golden brown on the edges but the tops are still pale
- Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the pan for 2 minutes.
- Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
- Repeat with the other piece of dough.
- Once cookies are cooled, take a cookie without a heart and spread 1/4tsp of jam with more in the center than the edges.
    - This way it will rise up through the heart.
- Top with a heart cut-out cookie.
