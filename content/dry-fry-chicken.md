## Ingredients
- 2 celery stalks, outer stems peeled
- 1 pound boneless chicken, chopped into 1-inch chunks
- 3 scallions, ends trimmed
- 1/4 cup peanut oil
- 8 dried hot red chiles (preferably Sichuan chiles)
- 1 teaspoon whole Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 1/2 tablespoons chili bean paste
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or medium-dry sherry
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- Salt
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil

## Directions

- Slice celery at steep angle into ½-inch slices. Set aside and toss with pinch of salt. Slice scallions at steep angle into ½-inch slices. Transfer to same bowl as celery.
- Pour oil into large wok set over high heat. 
- When smoking, add chicken. 
- Stir-fry until chicken has lost much of its water, about 5 minutes.
- Reduce heat to medium, and add chiles and Sichuan pepper. 
- Cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. 
- Add chili bean paste, and stir well. 
- Cook until it stains the oil red, about 10 seconds. 
- Add rice wine, dark soy sauce, and ¼ teaspoon of salt. 
- Cook, stirring often, until chicken looks dry and is very fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes.
- Add celery and scallions, and stir-fry until just tender, one to two minutes. 
- Turn off heat, pour in sesame oil, and season with salt to taste. 
- Stir well, and serve with white rice.
