## Ingredients

- 1 gallon of apple cider

## Directions

1. Place cider into large, flatbottomed pot
2. Bring cider to a boil
3. Reduce heat to a simmer.
4. Let simmer until volume has reduced to 2 1/3 cup.
  - Make sure to scrape the sides of the pot while reducing
  - Syrup will become much more viscous as it reduces.
  - Target viscosity will leave a notable trail in the pot when the bottom is wiped with a spatula.
5. Transfer liquid to desired containers.
